# Slack Workflow Status
This action will post workflow status notifications into your Slack channel. The notification includes the name of the Actor, Event, Branch, Workflow Name, Status and Run Durations. This action can optionally include the status and duration of individual jobs in a workflow to quickly help you identify where failures and slowdowns occur.

## Usage
To use this action properly, you should create a new `job` at the end of your workflow that `needs` all other jobs in the workflow. This ensures that this action is only run once all jobs in your workflow are complete.

This action requires `read` permission of `actions` scope. You should assign a job level `actions` permission if workflow level `actions` permission is set `none`.
